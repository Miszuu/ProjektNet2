        <br />
While this might come as a bit of a surprise, we’re still getting a lot of feedback from specific Korean pro players that Zerg has no chance vs. Terran. To explore this notion in greater details, we’ve pinged Kespa to get the stance of all the top players in KR to gauge the pro-stance as a whole. We have no actions planned yet, but we wanted to let you know so that we can all watch together to see if the situation actually is bad, and to discuss further moves together if they prove necessary. 
        <br />
The leading suggestion to test on this front so far is bringing the spawn larva count up from 3 to 4. We believe that this could be a good change if Zerg is really weak against Terran, and because we know that Protoss could very easily still be slightly ahead of Zerg in ZvP, it could be a good change there as well. However, the main potential negative to this change is that it would certainly affect early game play, and could to so to a degree that is more impactful than we intend.</div>

    <div class="news_naglowek">[Code A] Day 6 Preview - S2 2016O</div>
    <div class="news_tresc">Code A really heated up last week with all series on Day 5 ending in close 3-2 victories. HerO triumphed over Pet and his own nerves, securing another appearance in Code S. Seed once again proved to be one of the dirtiest players in the game by eliminating Sorry in typical cold-blooded fashion. And in the duel of the SKT titans Dark managed to overcome his colleague INnoVation, who is now eliminated from individual play in Korea for the rest of this year.
        <br />
The last full week of Code A begins now; there are still nine Code S spots waiting to be filled.</div>
